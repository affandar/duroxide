# Learning Series: rust-dtf Samples

This series walks through progressively richer orchestration samples. Each page shows real code (no test harness) and explains the core concepts.

Contents
- Hello World: basic activity and orchestration
- Basic Control Flow: branch on activity result
- Looping: repeated activities and tracing
- Error Handling: compensate on failure
- Fan-out/Fan-in: parallel activities
- System Activities: now_ms and new_guid
- Status Polling: using OrchestrationStatus
- Sub-orchestrations (basic)
- Sub-orchestrations (fan-out)
- Sub-orchestrations (chained)
- Detached Orchestrations (fire-and-forget)
- Typed Activity + Typed Orchestration
- Typed External Event
- Mixed String + Typed (typed orchestration)
- Mixed String + Typed (string orchestration)
