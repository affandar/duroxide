## üéØ Learning Path

### For New Users:
1. Start with the **[Quick Start Guide](../QUICK_START.md)**
2. Run the **[Hello World Example](../examples/hello_world.rs)**
3. Read the **[Orchestration Guide](ORCHESTRATION-GUIDE.md)** to understand how Duroxide works
4. Explore **[External Events](external-events.md)** and **[ContinueAsNew](continue-as-new.md)** for advanced patterns

### For Developers:
1. Review the **[Orchestration Guide](ORCHESTRATION-GUIDE.md)** for complete API reference
2. Study the **[Architecture](architecture.md)**
3. Understand the **[Execution Model](polling-and-execution-model.md)**
4. Check **[Design Invariants](design-invariants.md)** before contributing

### For Production Use:
1. Understand **[Reliability Guarantees](reliability-queue-and-history.md)**
2. Learn about **[ContinueAsNew](continue-as-new.md)** for long-running workflows
3. Plan for **[External Events](external-events.md)** integration

## üìñ Key Concepts Summary

- **Orchestrations**: Long-running workflows written as async Rust functions
- **Activities**: Stateless functions that perform actual work
- **Deterministic Replay**: Orchestrations replay from history to ensure consistency
- **Turn-Based Execution**: Progress happens through discrete turns triggered by completions
- **Correlation IDs**: Every operation has a unique ID for reliable matching

## üîß Common Use Cases

Duroxide is ideal for:
- **Order Processing**: Multi-step workflows with compensation
- **Data Pipelines**: Fan-out/fan-in processing with error handling
- **Approval Workflows**: Human-in-the-loop with timeouts
- **Monitoring**: Long-running monitoring with periodic checks
- **Batch Processing**: Large-scale data processing with checkpointing

## ü§ù Contributing

When contributing to documentation:
1. Update affected docs when changing behavior
2. Add new documents to this index
3. Follow the existing structure and style
4. Include code examples where appropriate
5. Test all code examples

## üÜò Getting Help

- Start with the examples - they demonstrate real patterns
- Check the test suite for working code
- Review architecture docs for deep understanding
- Open an issue for bugs or clarifications
