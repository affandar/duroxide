# Fix: Execution Status Persistence

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Issue:** `executions.status` column was never updated to reflect terminal orchestration states  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Tested

## Problem

The SQLite provider's `executions` table has a `status` column that tracks orchestration execution state:
- ✅ **Written correctly**: Set to `'Running'` when executions are created
- ❌ **Never updated**: Did not change to `'Completed'`, `'Failed'`, or `'ContinuedAsNew'` when orchestrations finished
- ❌ **Never read**: No code queried this column (status derived from history events instead)

This was a **data consistency issue**, not a functional bug. The `OrchestrationStatus` API worked correctly because it derives status from history events, not from the `executions.status` column.

## Root Cause

In `src/providers/sqlite.rs`, the `ack_orchestration_item()` method:
1. ✅ Correctly appended history events (including terminal events like `OrchestrationCompleted`)
2. ✅ Created executions with `status='Running'`
3. ❌ **Did not update** `executions.status` when terminal events were appended

## Solution

Added logic after history appending (line 734-802) to check for terminal events and update the `executions.status` column accordingly:

```rust:src/providers/sqlite.rs
// Update execution status based on terminal events
for event in &history_delta {
    match event {
        Event::OrchestrationCompleted { .. } => {
            sqlx::query(
                r#"
                UPDATE executions 
                SET status = 'Completed', completed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
                WHERE instance_id = ? AND execution_id = ?
                "#
            )
            .bind(&instance_id)
            .bind(execution_id)
            .execute(&mut *tx)
            .await
            .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
            break;
        }
        Event::OrchestrationFailed { .. } => {
            // Update to 'Failed'
            break;
        }
        Event::OrchestrationContinuedAsNew { .. } => {
            // Update to 'ContinuedAsNew'
            break;
        }
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

## Testing

### Tests Created

**File:** `tests/state_persistence_diagnostic.rs` (3 tests)

1. ✅ `diagnostic_state_persistence_completed`
   - Verifies `executions.status = 'Completed'` when orchestration succeeds
   - Confirms history events are correct

2. ✅ `diagnostic_state_persistence_failed`
   - Verifies `executions.status = 'Failed'` when orchestration fails
   - Confirms `OrchestrationFailed` event exists

3. ✅ `diagnostic_state_persistence_continue_as_new`
   - Verifies multi-execution state tracking:
     - Execution 1: `status = 'ContinuedAsNew'`
     - Execution 2: `status = 'Completed'`
   - Confirms correct execution IDs created

### Test Results

```
running 3 tests
📊 Executions.status in DB: Some("Completed")     ✅ CORRECT
📊 Executions.status in DB: Some("Failed")        ✅ CORRECT
📊 Execution statuses: [(1, "ContinuedAsNew"), (2, "Completed")]  ✅ CORRECT

test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed
```

### Regression Testing

All existing tests pass:
- ✅ `orchestration_status_tests` (8 tests)
- ✅ `continue_as_new_tests`
- ✅ `versioning_tests`
- ✅ All other test suites

## Benefits

1. **Database consistency**: `executions` table accurately reflects orchestration state
2. **Debugging**: Direct SQL queries show correct execution status
3. **Future features**: Can query/filter by execution status efficiently
4. **Monitoring**: Can build dashboards directly from database state

## Migration Notes

**No migration required** - existing rows with `status='Running'` will be corrected on next orchestration turn that produces a terminal event.

For historical accuracy, optionally run:
```sql
-- Fix completed orchestrations
UPDATE executions 
SET status = 'Completed' 
WHERE instance_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT instance_id 
    FROM history 
    WHERE event_type = 'OrchestrationCompleted'
);

-- Fix failed orchestrations  
UPDATE executions 
SET status = 'Failed' 
WHERE instance_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT instance_id 
    FROM history 
    WHERE event_type = 'OrchestrationFailed'
);

-- Fix continued orchestrations
UPDATE executions 
SET status = 'ContinuedAsNew' 
WHERE instance_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT instance_id 
    FROM history 
    WHERE event_type = 'OrchestrationContinuedAsNew'
);
```

## Impact

- **Priority**: Low (data consistency improvement)
- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal (single UPDATE query per terminal event)
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% maintained
