# User Prompts (Verbatim)

Lets start by some refactoring the create instance -> read -> append flow in start_internal_rx. A few points: * All information required to create a runtime representation of the instance should be available from the history. E.g. the name of the orchestration, the version should be written in the orchestration start. * This start event should also contain information about whether it is linked to a parent orchestration or not. * With the above in place I see no reason to have a) separate SubOrchestrationScheduled/Completed/Failed history events and b) the need to have a separate set and get instance metadata in the history provider since the metadata is already present in the orchestration started event. Tell me if you see issues with the above, and if not then build a plan to execute no this first step refactoring.

A few points: * Assume no backwards compatibility on the wire format is needed. * Lets skip removing the suborchestration* events, as you mentioned these are needed for the parent orchestrations’ replay. * Version shouldn’t be Option<String>, it is a must-have, its OK to break backwards compatibility.

yes

what are the next steps

Yes lets go ahead. In general, the rule is that the version resolution rules will be applied at runtime to figure out which version of the orchestration to pick up, but once the history is written the version on disk is the real "pin". Consequently, should have some tests which try to load the history with versions that are not in the registry anymore. These orchestrations should be marked as cancelled with the appropriate error.

in this test, post crash you should add back the child but a v2 version of it. the orchestration should still fail with the exact same error as the pinned version in the history is v1

keep going

"Expose get_orchestration_descriptor(instance) returning { name, version, parent_instance?, parent_id? } from history for introspection." Yes do it and add a few tests, also add to the public api docs

what is this code doing?

whats the significance of the pinned version in memory, why do we need it?

Lets come back to this one in a bit, remind me of this message when I ask you net time. For now I want to focus on this one: "Pre-persistence consistency: There’s a small window before the OrchestrationStarted { version } event is on disk. The in-memory pin ensures any immediate work (e.g., starting a child, or a quick replay/turn) uses the chosen version consistently during that window." This is definitely an issue. Any actions processed by the runtime should be as a result of explicitly dequeuing said actions and not through in-memory datas structures. How is this being handled in the code right now?

draw me an architecture diagram of all these components and their interactions. also would like a few sequence diagrams to illustrate what you put above

there was syntax error in the mermaid architecture diagram, draw it again

git commit and push

ok merge to main and push

ok new branch for an experimental refactor of the core replay engine pls

Ok this is a major refactor so let’s discuss this in detail. Basically I want to simplify the core replay radically and into the following parts: * Runtime which wires everything together, starts the dispatchers, loads up the registries. It has a lifecycle (start/stop etc). * There is a well defined component within runtime (call it the replay engine) that just handles the single threaded in-memory replay. Input is an orchestration fn and an existing history. Output is a set of decisions or instructions to the rest of the dispatchers. * Outside the replay engine within the runtime a component “catches” the decisions and acts on them by adding history entries and scheduling activities. This includes writing completion events for all scheduled work. * Orchestration dispatcher - handles messages destined for orchestrations, including messages for creating new orchestration instances. Reads off of the orchestrator queue implemented in the provider (using peeklock semantics). Invokes the runtime for actual replay. * Work dispatcher - handles messages for executing activities, creating new orchestrations (child or detached) etc. Reads off of the worker queue (peek-lock semantics as well). Sends responses to the orchestration queue. Note that this is a potential scale point for the future. As there can be N worker queues. * Timer dispatcher - same as the worker queue but for timer messages only. This is also a scale point, there could M timer queues Minimize in-memory optimizations for now, let’s work on correctness.

ok lets start

ok

go

ok

ok do it

ok

ok do it

yes lets do it

yes separate queues in provider

ok continue

ok continue

are we all done or are there next steps?

lets do the next steps except the hardening

yes do it

ok

yes commit what we got, create a new branch and collapse actions and decisions into one (decisions ie., which are emitted directly from the replay engine)

btw dont commit any of the dtf-data folder and files

what exactly is the role of the CompletionRouter? give me details about its lifecycle as well

ok lets get rid of the activity worker and collapse that functionality into the work dispatcher. move the activity registry next to the orchestrationregistry in registry.rs

yes go ahead

ok

do it

ok commit and then create yet another branch for another major simplification

is the activityworker used now that we have the three dispatchers?

so we need to rethink this a bit. running instance to completion won't scale, activities can be very long running, there is no point in keeping the orchestration idling in the active instances while that is happening. what we want is to dehydrate an active instance if there is no work for a while (as determined by no new completions) and then rehydrate it if a new completion shows up. and by rehydrated I really mean that minimal memory and CPU cycles are consumed while processing an inactive orchestration. give me a plan for this

ok lets do it

test event_before_subscription_after_start_is_ignored has been running for over 60 seconds

ok

ok

do it

ok to be clear, the activity registry should not be hanging off of the orchestration registry but be a separate entity at the same level as the orchestration registry. pls fix that and I think that will fix this issue as well

can activity.rs be safely removed now?

fix all the build warnings

isnt this supposed to actually trace something?

ok now investigate and fix the failing tests

git commit and tag work as "checkpoint1 - about to remove start tx/rv"

Ok we are going to remove this extra message passing layer between the need to create an active instance in memory and the actual in-memory orchestration. It is adding complexity without any solid benefit. Give me a plan for that.

ok lets do it

is this even used now that the workitem dispatcher is processing activities?

what is the point of activity_tx if no one is receiving from activity_rx??

yes lets do it

lets rename this to "InstanceRouter"

git commit and mark it as checkpoint2

So for next time, please remember that whenever making larger changes or refactorings, look for what code is now not being used and also add to your work items one line item to clean that up

yes set max_width to 120 and re-run pls

it didnt change the line lengths in mod.rs at least?

git commit

yes push

for this file set line length to no more than 120. cargo fmt clearly wasn't able to handle this one

for this file set line length to no more than 120. cargo fmt clearly wasn't able to handle this one

why did that test fail?

poke the instance

whats the differnece in externalevent and externalbyname>

when is externalevent called vs by name?

is ExternalEvent dead code?

lets remove it and only keep the externalbyname

wouldn't these timers already be scheduled when the decisions were applied when the timercreated events were written?

ok lets remove it then

if instance already exists then we don't need to see the startorchestration workitem again right? i.e. we could just no-op, write a warn and just drop it

this test is flaky, investigate:

fix the error

how to enable full debug trace in the tests?

expand to print the actual history in the debug log

so Interestingly, even a timer fired which was not originally scheduled should result in a non deterministic orchestration error.. correct?

lets add another test which tests for the completion kind mismatch. Also remind me if the completions carry the execution id? If they don't carry execution id then evaluate whether this could cause issues with continueasnew

yes go ahead and implement the execution id in completions, but a few notes: * first move the non determinism tests into one test file i.e. e2e_nondeterminism * commit the current branch and label it as checkpoint 4 * for the execution id fix, if the execution id of a completion is not the current execution id of the running instance (and assert that the runnign instances execution id is higher) then write a warn! and ignore the completion. * make sure that in code we only have the latest and greatest execution id in memory

tests have build errors

point me to the tests you jsut added

the orchestration would be done by now, how would this enqueue help?

commit and push to remote

ok, build me a design doc that explains in detail all the interactions between the various components, and how replay actually works.

ok where is the document?

give a high level summary at the top of the doc in a bit more verbos text on how the replay works and how it supports "durable execution" of workflows

good, how about add another example of a cloud provisioing system where user is provisioing a VM some network components and a storage acct etc
