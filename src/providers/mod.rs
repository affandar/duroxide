///
/// This represents a locked batch of work for a single orchestration instance.
/// The provider must guarantee that no other process can modify this instance
/// until `ack_orchestration_item()` or `abandon_orchestration_item()` is called.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// * `instance` - Unique identifier for the orchestration instance (e.g., "order-123")
/// * `orchestration_name` - Name of the orchestration being executed (e.g., "ProcessOrder")
/// * `execution_id` - Current execution ID (starts at 1, increments with ContinueAsNew)
/// * `version` - Orchestration version string (e.g., "1.0.0")
/// * `history` - Complete event history for the current execution (ordered by event_id)
/// * `messages` - Batch of WorkItems to process (may include Start, completions, external events)
/// * `lock_token` - Unique token that must be used to ack or abandon this batch
///
/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// - The provider must ensure `history` contains ALL events for `execution_id` in order
/// - For multi-execution instances (ContinueAsNew), only return the LATEST execution's history
/// - The `lock_token` must be unique and prevent concurrent processing of the same instance
/// - All messages in the batch should belong to the same instance
/// - The lock should expire after a timeout (e.g., 30s) to handle worker crashes
///
/// # Example from SQLite Provider
///
/// ```text
/// // 1. Lock all visible messages for an instance
/// UPDATE orchestrator_queue SET lock_token = ?, locked_until = ?
/// WHERE instance_id = ? AND lock_token IS NULL
///
/// // 2. Load instance metadata
/// SELECT orchestration_name, orchestration_version, current_execution_id
/// FROM instances WHERE instance_id = ?
///
/// // 3. Load history for current execution
/// SELECT event_data FROM history
/// WHERE instance_id = ? AND execution_id = ?
/// ORDER BY event_id
///
/// // 4. Return OrchestrationItem with lock_token

///
/// This design ensures the provider remains a pure storage abstraction without orchestration knowledge.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// * `status` - New execution status: `Some("Completed")`, `Some("Failed")`, `Some("ContinuedAsNew")`, or `None`

/// ```
///
/// # ContinueAsNew Handling
///
/// ContinueAsNew is handled entirely by the runtime. Providers must NOT try to
/// synthesize new executions in `fetch_orchestration_item`.
///
/// Runtime behavior:
/// - When an orchestration calls `continue_as_new(input)`, the runtime stamps
///   `OrchestrationContinuedAsNew` into the current execution's history and enqueues
///   a `WorkItem::ContinueAsNew`.
/// - When processing that work item, the runtime starts a fresh execution with
///   `execution_id = current + 1`, passes an empty `existing_history`, and stamps an
///   `OrchestrationStarted { event_id: 1, .. }` event for the new execution.
/// - The runtime then calls `ack_orchestration_item(lock_token, execution_id, ...)` with
///   the explicit execution id to persist history and queue operations.
///
/// Provider responsibilities:
/// - Use the explicit `execution_id` given to `ack_orchestration_item`.
/// - Idempotently create the execution row (`INSERT OR IGNORE`).
/// - Update `instances.current_execution_id = MAX(current_execution_id, execution_id)`.
/// - Append all `history_delta` events to the specified `execution_id`.
/// - Update `executions.status, executions.output` from `ExecutionMetadata` when provided.

///

/// - `StartOrchestration, ContinueAsNew, ActivityCompleted/Failed, TimerFired, ExternalRaised, SubOrchCompleted/Failed, CancelInstance` → **Orchestrator queue**
/// - `ActivityExecute` → **Worker queue**
/// - `TimerSchedule` → **Timer queue**
///
/// # Instance ID Extraction
///
/// Most WorkItems have an `instance` field. Sub-orchestration completions use `parent_instance`.
/// Providers need to extract the instance ID for routing. SQLite example:
///
/// ```ignore
/// let instance = match &item {
///     WorkItem::StartOrchestration { instance, .. } |
///     WorkItem::ActivityCompleted { instance, .. } |
///     WorkItem::CancelInstance { instance, .. } => instance,
///     WorkItem::SubOrchCompleted { parent_instance, .. } => parent_instance,
///     _ => return Err("unexpected item type"),
/// };
/// ```
///
/// # Execution ID Tracking
///
/// WorkItems for activities, timers, and sub-orchestrations include `execution_id`.
/// This allows providers to route completions to the correct execution when ContinueAsNew creates multiple executions.

///
/// # Design Principles
///
/// **Providers should be storage abstractions, NOT orchestration engines:**
/// - ✅ Store and retrieve events as opaque data (don't inspect Event contents)
/// - ✅ Manage queues and locks (generic queue operations)
/// - ✅ Provide ACID guarantees where possible
/// - ❌ DON'T interpret orchestration semantics (use ExecutionMetadata from runtime)
/// - ❌ DON'T create events (runtime creates all events)
/// - ❌ DON'T make orchestration decisions (runtime decides control flow)
///
/// # Multi-Execution Support (ContinueAsNew)
///
/// Orchestration instances can have multiple executions (execution_id 1, 2, 3, ...):
/// - Each execution has its own event history
/// - `read()` should return the LATEST execution's history
/// - Provider tracks current_execution_id to know which execution is active
/// - When metadata.create_next_execution=true, create new execution row
///
/// **Example:**
/// ```text
/// Instance "order-123":
///   Execution 1: [OrchestrationStarted, ActivityScheduled, OrchestrationContinuedAsNew]
///   Execution 2: [OrchestrationStarted, ActivityScheduled, OrchestrationCompleted]
///   
///   read("order-123") → Returns Execution 2's events (latest)
///   read_with_execution("order-123", 1) → Returns Execution 1's events
///   latest_execution_id("order-123") → Returns Some(2)
/// ```
///
/// # Concurrency Model
///
/// The runtime runs 3 background dispatchers polling your queues:
/// 1. **Orchestration Dispatcher**: Polls fetch_orchestration_item() continuously
/// 2. **Work Dispatcher**: Polls dequeue_worker_peek_lock() continuously
/// 3. **Timer Dispatcher**: Polls dequeue_timer_peek_lock() continuously
///
/// **Your implementation must be thread-safe** and support concurrent access from multiple dispatchers.
///
/// # Peek-Lock Pattern (Critical)
///
/// All dequeue operations use peek-lock semantics:
/// 1. **Peek**: Select and lock a message (message stays in queue)
/// 2. **Process**: Runtime processes the locked message
/// 3. **Ack**: Delete message from queue (success) OR
/// 4. **Abandon**: Release lock for retry (failure)
///
/// Benefits:
/// - At-least-once delivery (messages survive crashes)
/// - Automatic retry on worker failure (lock expires)
/// - Prevents duplicate processing (locked messages invisible to others)
///
/// # Transactional Guarantees
///
/// **`ack_orchestration_item()` is the atomic boundary:**
/// - ALL operations in ack must succeed or fail together
/// - History append + queue enqueues + lock release = atomic
/// - If commit fails, entire turn is retried
/// - This ensures exactly-once semantics for orchestration turns
///
/// # Queue Message Flow
///
/// **Orchestrator Queue:**
/// - Inputs: StartOrchestration, ActivityCompleted/Failed, TimerFired, ExternalRaised, SubOrchCompleted/Failed, CancelInstance, ContinueAsNew
/// - Output: Processed by orchestration dispatcher → ack_orchestration_item
/// - Batching: All messages for an instance processed together
///
/// **Worker Queue:**
/// - Inputs: ActivityExecute (from ack_orchestration_item)
/// - Output: Processed by work dispatcher → ActivityCompleted/Failed to orch queue
/// - Batching: One message at a time (activities executed independently)
///
/// **Timer Queue:**
/// - Inputs: TimerSchedule (from ack_orchestration_item)
/// - Output: Processed by timer dispatcher → TimerFired to orch queue
/// - Visibility: Messages become visible at fire_at_ms (if supported)
///
/// # Instance Metadata Management
///
/// Providers typically maintain metadata about instances:
/// - instance_id (primary key)
/// - orchestration_name, orchestration_version
/// - current_execution_id (for multi-execution support)
/// - status, output (optional, for quick queries)
/// - created_at, updated_at timestamps
///
/// This metadata is updated via:
/// - `enqueue_orchestrator_work()` with StartOrchestration
/// - `ack_orchestration_item()` with history changes
/// - `ExecutionMetadata` for status/output updates
///
/// # Required vs Optional Methods
///
/// **REQUIRED** (must implement):
/// - fetch_orchestration_item, ack_orchestration_item, abandon_orchestration_item
/// - read, append_with_execution
/// - enqueue_worker_work, dequeue_worker_peek_lock, ack_worker
/// - enqueue_orchestrator_work
///
/// **OPTIONAL** (has defaults):
/// - latest_execution_id, read_with_execution
/// - list_instances, list_executions
///
/// # Recommended Database Schema (SQL Example)
///
/// ```sql
/// -- Instance metadata
/// CREATE TABLE instances (
///     instance_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,

///     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
/// );
/// ```
///
/// # Implementing a New Provider: Checklist
///
/// 1. ✅ **Storage Layer**: Choose backing store (PostgreSQL, Redis, DynamoDB, etc.)
/// 2. ✅ **Serialization**: Use serde_json for Event and WorkItem (or compatible format)
/// 3. ✅ **Locking**: Implement peek-lock with unique tokens and expiration
/// 4. ✅ **Transactions**: Ensure `ack_orchestration_item` is atomic
/// 5. ✅ **Indexes**: Add indexes on `instance_id`, `lock_token`, `visible_at`, `fire_at`
/// 6. ✅ **Testing**: Use `tests/sqlite_provider_test.rs` as a template
/// 7. ✅ **Multi-execution**: Support execution_id partitioning for ContinueAsNew
/// 8. ⚠️ **DO NOT**: Inspect event contents (use ExecutionMetadata)
/// 9. ⚠️ **DO NOT**: Create events (runtime owns event creation)
/// 10. ⚠️ **DO NOT**: Make orchestration decisions (runtime owns logic)

/// - ✅ Manage queues and locks (generic queue operations)
/// - ✅ Provide ACID guarantees where possible
/// - ❌ DON'T interpret orchestration semantics (use ExecutionMetadata from runtime)
/// - ❌ DON'T create events (runtime creates all events)
/// - ❌ DON'T make orchestration decisions (runtime decides control flow)
///
/// # Multi-Execution Support (ContinueAsNew)
///
/// Orchestration instances can have multiple executions (execution_id 1, 2, 3, ...):
/// - Each execution has its own event history
/// - `read()` should return the LATEST execution's history
/// - Provider tracks current_execution_id to know which execution is active
/// - When metadata.create_next_execution=true, create new execution row
///
/// **Example:**
/// ```text
/// Instance "order-123":
///   Execution 1: [OrchestrationStarted, ActivityScheduled, OrchestrationContinuedAsNew]
///   Execution 2: [OrchestrationStarted, ActivityScheduled, OrchestrationCompleted]
///   
///   read("order-123") → Returns Execution 2's events (latest)
///   read_with_execution("order-123", 1) → Returns Execution 1's events
///   latest_execution_id("order-123") → Returns Some(2)
///   list_executions("order-123") → Returns vec!\[1, 2\]
/// ```
///
/// # Concurrency Model
///
/// The runtime runs 3 background dispatchers polling your queues:
/// 1. **Orchestration Dispatcher**: Polls fetch_orchestration_item() continuously
/// 2. **Work Dispatcher**: Polls dequeue_worker_peek_lock() continuously
/// 3. **Timer Dispatcher**: Polls dequeue_timer_peek_lock() continuously
///
/// **Your implementation must be thread-safe** and support concurrent access from multiple dispatchers.
///
/// # Peek-Lock Pattern (Critical)
///
/// All dequeue operations use peek-lock semantics:
/// 1. **Peek**: Select and lock a message (message stays in queue)
/// 2. **Process**: Runtime processes the locked message
/// 3. **Ack**: Delete message from queue (success) OR
/// 4. **Abandon**: Release lock for retry (failure)
///
/// Benefits:
/// - At-least-once delivery (messages survive crashes)
/// - Automatic retry on worker failure (lock expires)
/// - Prevents duplicate processing (locked messages invisible to others)
///
/// # Transactional Guarantees
///
/// **`ack_orchestration_item()` is the atomic boundary:**
/// - ALL operations in ack must succeed or fail together
/// - History append + queue enqueues + lock release = atomic
/// - If commit fails, entire turn is retried
/// - This ensures exactly-once semantics for orchestration turns
///
/// # Queue Message Flow
///
/// **Orchestrator Queue:**
/// - Inputs: StartOrchestration, ActivityCompleted/Failed, TimerFired, ExternalRaised, SubOrchCompleted/Failed, CancelInstance, ContinueAsNew
/// - Output: Processed by orchestration dispatcher → ack_orchestration_item
/// - Batching: All messages for an instance processed together
/// - Ordering: FIFO per instance preferred
///
/// **Worker Queue:**
/// - Inputs: ActivityExecute (from ack_orchestration_item)
/// - Output: Processed by work dispatcher → ActivityCompleted/Failed to orch queue
/// - Batching: One message at a time (activities executed independently)
/// - Ordering: FIFO preferred but not required
///
/// **Timer Queue:**
/// - Inputs: TimerSchedule (from ack_orchestration_item)
/// - Output: Processed by timer dispatcher → TimerFired to orch queue
/// - Visibility: Messages become visible at fire_at_ms (if supported)
/// - Ordering: By fire_at_ms (earliest first)
///
/// # Instance Metadata Management
///
/// Providers typically maintain metadata about instances:
/// - instance_id (primary key)
/// - orchestration_name, orchestration_version (from StartOrchestration)
/// - current_execution_id (for multi-execution support)
/// - status, output (optional, from ExecutionMetadata)
/// - created_at, updated_at timestamps
///
/// This metadata is updated via:
/// - `enqueue_orchestrator_work()` with StartOrchestration (creates instance)
/// - `ack_orchestration_item()` with ExecutionMetadata (updates status/output)
/// - `ack_orchestration_item()` with metadata.create_next_execution (increments current_execution_id)
///
/// # Error Handling Philosophy
///
/// - **Transient errors** (busy, timeout): Return error, let runtime retry
/// - **Invalid tokens**: Return Ok (idempotent - already processed)
/// - **Corruption** (missing instance, invalid data): Return error
/// - **Concurrency conflicts**: Handle via locks, return error if deadlock
///
/// # Required vs Optional Methods
///
/// **REQUIRED** (must implement):
/// - fetch_orchestration_item, ack_orchestration_item, abandon_orchestration_item
/// - read, append_with_execution
/// - enqueue_worker_work, dequeue_worker_peek_lock, ack_worker
/// - enqueue_orchestrator_work
///
/// **OPTIONAL** (has defaults):
/// - latest_execution_id, read_with_execution
/// - list_instances, list_executions
///
/// # Testing Your Provider
///
/// See `tests/sqlite_provider_test.rs` for comprehensive provider tests:
/// - Basic enqueue/dequeue operations
/// - Transactional atomicity
/// - Lock expiration and redelivery
/// - Multi-execution support
/// - Execution status and output persistence
///
/// All tests use the Provider trait directly (not runtime), so they're portable to new providers.
///
/// Core provider trait for runtime orchestration operations.
///
/// This trait defines the essential methods required for durable orchestration execution.
/// It focuses on runtime-critical operations: fetching work items, processing history,
/// and managing queues. Management and observability features are provided through
/// optional capability traits.
///
/// # Capability Discovery
///
/// Providers can implement additional capability traits (like `ManagementCapability`)
/// to expose richer features. The `Client` automatically discovers these capabilities
/// through the `as_management_capability()` method.
///
/// # Implementation Guide for LLMs
///
/// When implementing a new provider, focus on these core methods:
///
/// ## Required Methods (9 total)
///
/// 1. **Orchestration Processing (3 methods)**
///    - `fetch_orchestration_item()` - Atomic batch processing
///    - `ack_orchestration_item()` - Commit processing results
///    - `abandon_orchestration_item()` - Release locks and retry
///
/// 2. **History Access (1 method)**
///    - `read()` - Get event history for status checks
///
/// 3. **Worker Queue (2 methods)**
///    - `dequeue_worker_peek_lock()` - Get activity work items
///    - `ack_worker()` - Acknowledge activity completion
///
/// 4. **Orchestrator Queue (1 method)**
///    - `enqueue_orchestrator_work()` - Enqueue control messages (including TimerFired with delayed visibility)
///
/// ## Optional Management Methods (2 methods)
///
/// These are included for backward compatibility but will be moved to
/// `ManagementCapability` in future versions:
///
/// - `list_instances()` - List all instance IDs
/// - `list_executions()` - List execution IDs for an instance
///
/// # Capability Detection
///
/// Implement `as_management_capability()` to expose management features:
///
/// ```ignore
/// impl Provider for MyProvider {
///     // ... implement required methods
///     
///     fn as_management_capability(&self) -> Option<&dyn ManagementCapability> {
///         Some(self as &dyn ManagementCapability)
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl ManagementCapability for MyProvider {
///     // ... implement management methods
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Testing Your Provider
///
/// See `tests/sqlite_provider_test.rs` for comprehensive provider tests:
/// - Basic enqueue/dequeue operations
/// - Transactional atomicity
/// - Lock expiration and redelivery
/// - Multi-execution support
/// - Execution status and output persistence
///

    // ===== Core Atomic Orchestration Methods (REQUIRED) =====
    // These three methods form the heart of reliable orchestration execution.
    //
    // ⚠️ CRITICAL ID GENERATION CONTRACT:
    //
    // The provider MUST NOT generate execution_id or event_id values.
    // All IDs are generated by the runtime and passed to the provider:
    //   - execution_id: Passed to ack_orchestration_item()
    //   - event_id: Set in each Event in the history_delta
    //
    // The provider's role is to STORE these IDs, not generate them.

    /// Fetch the next orchestration work item atomically.
    ///
    /// # What This Does
    ///
    /// 1. **Select an instance to process**: Find the next available message in orchestrator queue
    /// 2. **Lock ALL messages** for that instance (batch processing)
    /// 3. **Load history**: Get complete event history for the current execution
    /// 4. **Load metadata**: Get orchestration_name, version, execution_id
    /// 5. **Return locked batch**: Provider must prevent other processes from touching this instance
    ///
    /// # Peek-Lock Semantics
    ///
    /// - Messages remain in queue until `ack_orchestration_item()` is called
    /// - Generate a unique `lock_token` (e.g., UUID)
    /// - Set `locked_until` timestamp (e.g., now + 30 seconds)
    /// - If lock expires before ack, messages become available again (automatic retry)
    ///
    /// # Visibility Filtering
    ///
    /// Only return messages where `visible_at <= now()`:
    /// - Normal messages: visible immediately
    /// - Delayed messages: `visible_at = now + delay_ms` (used for timer backpressure)
    ///
    /// # Instance Batching
    ///
    /// **CRITICAL:** All messages in the batch must belong to the SAME instance.
    ///
    /// SQLite implementation:
    /// 1. Find first visible unlocked message: `SELECT instance_id FROM orchestrator_queue WHERE visible_at <= now ORDER BY id LIMIT 1`
    /// 2. Lock ALL messages for that instance: `UPDATE orchestrator_queue SET lock_token = ? WHERE instance_id = ?`
    /// 3. Fetch all locked messages: `SELECT * FROM orchestrator_queue WHERE lock_token = ?`
    ///
    /// # History Loading
    ///
    /// - For new instances (no history yet): return empty Vec
    /// - For existing instances: return ALL events for current execution_id, ordered by event_id
    /// - For multi-execution instances: return ONLY the LATEST execution's history
    ///
    /// SQLite example:
    /// ```text
    /// // Get current execution ID
    /// let exec_id = SELECT current_execution_id FROM instances WHERE instance_id = ?
    ///
    /// // Load history for that execution
    /// SELECT event_data FROM history
    /// WHERE instance_id = ? AND execution_id = ?
    /// ORDER BY event_id
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Return Value
    ///
    /// - `Some(OrchestrationItem)` - Work is available and locked
    /// - `None` - No work available (dispatcher will sleep and retry)
    ///
    /// # Error Handling
    ///
    /// Don't panic on transient errors - return None and let dispatcher retry.
    /// Only panic on unrecoverable errors (e.g., corrupted database schema).
    ///
    /// # Concurrency
    ///
    /// This method is called continuously by the orchestration dispatcher.
    /// Must be thread-safe and handle concurrent calls gracefully.
    ///
    /// # Example Implementation Pattern

    /// 1. **Append new events** to history for current execution
    /// 2. **Update execution metadata** (status, output) using pre-computed metadata

    /// 7. **Delete acknowledged messages** from orchestrator queue (release lock)
    ///
    /// # Atomicity Requirements
    ///
    /// **CRITICAL:** All 7 operations above must succeed or fail together.
    ///
    /// - **If ANY operation fails**: Roll back the entire transaction
    /// - **If commit succeeds**: All changes are durable and visible

    /// **Important:** Store events exactly as provided. DO NOT:
    /// - Modify event_id (runtime assigns these)
    /// - Inspect event contents to make decisions
