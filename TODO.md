## Durable Task Rust Core â€“ TODOs

- Drop crates/dependencies that aren't needed
- Add orchestrator functions
- Macros for syntactic sugar [DESIGNED - see docs/proposals/MACRO-FINAL-DESIGN.md]

### Reliability & Provider API

- macros for activities, orchestrations
- orchestration functions!
- build node and python bindings as well
- convert execution, instance statuses to enums
- Introduce a provider error type with Retryable/NonRetryable classification; update runtime to use it for retries across all provider ops (not just ack_orchestration_item)
- Proper lock / visibility timeouts
- review duplicate orch instance ids
- perf pass over replay engine
- parallelize dispatcher loops
- lock TTL for timer and worker queues and update lease
- Reduce ornamental user code in orchestrations and acivities
- Continue the provider simplification
- Rename to provider
- fault inject: "TODO : fault injection :"
- code coverage
- CLI tooling to manipulate history/queue state for devops
- add cancellation and status from within the orchestration
- example versioned crates with orchestrations and loaders
- profiling replay and providers
- performance improvements for runtime
- "pub-sub" external events
- sharding and scale out to multiple runtimes
- strongly typed activity and orchestration calls?
- cancellations via JoinHandles?
- Add proper metrics.
- Build a website to visualize execution.
- Write an Azure Blob based provider.
- Batch the calls to logging, don't spin up an activity per
- Orchestration state? Monitoring? Visiblity? 
- Real world samples (provisioning resources in Azure e.g.)

## DONE

- sqlite instance table should not have a status, it should only be in the execution table
- updated to sqlx 0.8
- remove unused crate dependencies
- Update all provider and API docs, get ready to push crate
- implementing a provider requires the implementor to look deeply at the sqlite provider code
- clean up leaky abstractions (provider should not have to compute the orchestration state and output e.g)
- drop the polling frequence for the dispatchers
- Cleanup the docs before making public
- write a real world orchestrations with versioning etc
- fix up the tracing to not use activities [DONE - tracing is now host-side only]
- host level events (tracing, guid, time) [IN PROGRESS via RFC]
- SQLite provider with full transactional support and e2e test parity
  - Full ACID transactional semantics
  - Provider-backed timer queue with delayed visibility
  - Handles concurrent instance execution
  - All 25 core e2e tests passing
- Fixed trace activities to be fire-and-forget (no longer cause nondeterminism)
- Timer acknowledgment only after firing (reliability fix)
- Worker queue acknowledgment only after completion enqueue (reliability fix)
- Return instance history as well
- Update history + complete locks + enqueue in the same call
- typed parameters for activities and orchestrations
- proper timer implementation in the provider
- versioning strategy
- Support for orchestration chaining + eternal orchestrations
- Need to understand this oneshot channel to await on
- transactional processing - harden queue read semantics (see docs/reliability-queue-and-history.md)
- review how active_instances in the runtime work, why are we reenqueuing events in certain cases
- On next session: review tests covering ContinueAsNew and multi-execution IDs
	- Files: `tests/e2e_continue_as_new.rs` (both tests)
	- Also revisit runtime APIs to surface `list_executions` and `get_execution_history` consistently- ContinueAsNew support
- test hung because the initial orchestration takes longer to start!
- tests for orchestration state, 
- tests for provider <-> runtime resumption of multiple orchestrations. 
- dequeue multiple item batch
- do a pass through the code. 
- Add orchestration registry
- Add capability to the runtime to resume persisted orchestrations from the history provider
- Add signalling mechanism in the provider which runtime can poll to trigger replay
- resolve the test hang!!
- Document all methods
- Add proper logging
- Write a file system based provider.
- Crash recovery tests.
- Error handling for bad activity or orchestration names, or accessing wrong instance IDs
- Add a Gabbar test
- Logging typed handlers
- Max size of orchestration history
- Detailed documentation in the docs folder for how the system works
- Remove dead code, including the one with allow(dead_code)
- Write detailed architecture and user documentation 
- Formalize a provider model for the state, queues and timers.
- Write GUID and time deterministic helper methods.

## POSTPONED

- implement Unpin typed future wrappers for `_typed` adapters
- redo the orchestration registry change with gpt5 and compare
- mermaid diagrams for orchestrations???
- remove the into_activity() and similar methods
